   Some of this source code is older than the concept of time; the complete
list of authors would be nigh impossible to assemble.
   The known subset includes:
Doug Comer, Bob Brown, Raj Yavatkar, Shawn Osterman, Andy Muckelbauer,
Vince Russo, John Lin, Mike Evangelista, Gustavo Rodriguez-Rivera,
Dan Trinkle, Ben Kuperman, Florian Kerschbaum, Chris Telfer, and Dennis Brylow.
All of these folks were at or associated with Purdue University's Department
of Computer Science some time between the mid 1970's and the turn of
the second millenium.
