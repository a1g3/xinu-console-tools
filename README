   This directory contains the source for the complete set of XINU Lab
console tools.  This includes the client-side programs xinu-console and
xinu-status, as well as the xinu-consoled daemon and all of its support
utilities.

   Contents:
	src/		Source for xinu-consoled daemon and console tools.
	include/	Headers shared between all the utilities.
	lib/		Libraries (mostly networking calls) shared by all
			the utilities.
	man/		Man pages for xinu-*.
	scripts/	Supporting scripts and wrappers.


   These tools have recently been "autotoolized", as a first pass at
making them more portable.  However, very little effort has been put
into reacting properly should any of the autoconf tests fail, so this
is really only known to work well in Fedora Core Linux at present.
   Previous incarnations have run reliably on Solaris, BSD, and other
flavors of UNIX, so the code should be fairly portable.
   See INSTALL for more info on actual deployment of this system.
